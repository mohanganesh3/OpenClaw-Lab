Abstract
Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and
tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for auto-
mated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS),
a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled represen-
tations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the
other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher net-
work, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through
pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-
aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each
student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of
up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our
code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/hieuphamha19/CSDS.

1 Introduction
Histopathological image analysis is of paramount importance in cancer diagnosis and prog-
nosis, especially in tasks such as gland segmentation for colorectal cancer. Images are usually
stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). This staining can create significant color dif-
ferences due to variations in staining methods, slide preparation, and scanning equipment
used. The differences in color and structure of tissue images create considerable obstacles

for automated segmentation systems, especially when there is a lack of labeled data. In
medical imaging, however, obtaining such labels is expensive, time-consuming, and subject
to inter-observer variability.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers an effective strategy to improve segmentation per-
formance by leveraging a small amount of labeled data alongside a larger pool of unlabeled
samples. However, existing SSL methods often overlook the unique visual complexity of
histopathological images, which arises from two entangled yet semantically distinct sources:
staining variations and tissue morphology. In particular, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
staining introduces substantial inter-sample color variation due to inconsistencies in stain-
ing protocols and scanning devices, while structural variations reflect biologically meaning-
ful changes in tissue architecture, including malignant progression. Prior works in semi-
supervised segmentation, such as pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization Sohn et al.
(2020); Le et al. (2025), and teacher-student frameworks Tarvainen and Valpola (2017);
Yu et al. (2019); Pham et al. (2025), generally process the image holistically and fail to
disentangle stain and structure cues. This lack of targeted representation learning can limit
their effectiveness in histopathology, where isolating stain-specific and structure-specific
information is crucial for robust and interpretable segmentation.
To overcome the limitations of existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches, we
propose in this work a novel framework termed Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS).
The key innovation of CSDS lies in its explicit decoupling of color and structural information
through the use of two specialized student networks. One student is trained with color-
augmented images to effectively model chromatic variations, while the other is trained with
geometrically transformed images to emphasize structural cues. A shared teacher model,
updated using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student weights, then serves
as a pseudo-label generator and provides supervision in an uncertainty-aware manner.
To further enhance pseudo-label reliability, we introduce color-aware and structure-
aware uncertainty estimation strategies.
These mechanisms leverage prediction entropy
and domain-specific priors to adaptively weight the contributions of each student dur-
ing training, thereby improving the quality and robustness of the supervision signal. We
validate the effectiveness of CSDS through comprehensive experiments conducted on two
histopathological image segmentation benchmarks, GlaS Sirinukunwattana et al. (2017) and
CRAG Graham et al. (2019), under low-label regimes. The results demonstrate that CSDS
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new benchmark
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
2 Methodology
2.1 Preliminary
Problem Settings.
Following standard semi-supervised segmentation settings, we denote
the labeled set as Dl = {(xl
i, yl
i)}N
i=1, and a larger unlabeled set as Du = {(xu
k)}M
k=1 (N:
labeled samples, M: unlabeled samples, M ≫N). Here, xl
i and xu
k are input images from
the labeled and unlabeled sets, respectively, and yl
i is the corresponding one-hot groundtruth
for labeled sample xl
i. This setup formalizes the standard semi-supervised segmentation
problem under a limited-label regime.

Overall Pipeline. We propose a Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS) framework, an
extension of the Mean Teacher paradigm Tarvainen and Valpola (2017). Our framework
is built upon the intuition that color and structure represent two complementary sources
of variation in histological data: while color distributions often shift across staining pro-
tocols, structural patterns exhibit large inter-sample variability due to tissue deformation
and cancer heterogeneity. CSDS comprises two student networks with shared architecture:
the color student, trained on inputs augmented by histogram matching and color jittering
to capture both in-distribution and out-of-distribution color shifts; and the structure stu-
dent, optimized on elastically deformed images to model structural variability. A shared
teacher network is updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the mean weights
from both students. In Section 2.2 we introduce two complementary uncertainty estimation
modules: Color uncertainty and structure uncertainty, which quantify prediction confidence
via entropy in color-ambiguous and structurally-uncertain regions, respectively. These un-
certainty maps are subsequently used to modulate the teacher’s supervision signals during
the pseudo-labeling process. The overall pipeline of our method is illustrated in Figure 1.
2.2 Uncertainty Estimation for Color-Structure Uncertainty Module
In this section, we present the detailed design of the Color Uncertainty and Structure Uncer-
tainty modules. Uncertainty map is initially computed from the teacher’s predictions using
Shannon entropy Shannon (1948) and is further refined by incorporating visual features
extracted from input images, guided by color and structural indicators Zou et al. (2023).

2.2.1 Entropy-Based Uncertainty Estimation
Given the teacher’s output logits z ∈RC×H×W , we compute per-pixel softmax probabilities:
p(x) = softmax(z(x)),
(1)
where z(x) denotes the logit at pixel x. Uncertainty is then estimated as:
U(x) = −
C
X
c=1
pc(x) log(pc(x) + ε),
(2)
where ε is a small constant added for numerical stability. This produces a dense uncertainty
map that reflects the teacher’s predictive confidence.
2.2.2 Color-Aware Uncertainty Modulation
Within the domain of pathology imaging, local color diversity often reflects meaningful
semantic variation Xia et al. (2024). Given the input RGB image I ∈R3×H×W , we estimate
chromatic complexity by computing the per-pixel inter-channel variance:
σ2(x) = Varc∈{R,G,B}[Ic(x)].
(3)
To enforce spatial coherence, the variance map is smoothed using a Gaussian filter G3×3, or
approximated via average pooling for computational efficiency:
V (x) = G3×3(σ2(x)),
ˆV (x) =
V (x)
maxx∈ΩV (x) + ε.
(4)
A binary mask highlights regions with high color diversity:
MC(x) = I[ ˆV (x) > τcolor].
(5)
We then modulate the base uncertainty map U(x) by amplifying values in chromatically
distinctive regions:
eUC(x) = U(x) · (1 + λC · MC(x)) ,
(6)
where λC ∈[0, 1] controls the degree of modulation. This adjustment selectively increases
uncertainty in visually rich areas where semantic ambiguity may be elevated.
2.2.3 Structure-Aware Uncertainty Modulation
Uncertainty tends to rise near object boundaries and regions of strong visual transition,
where label ambiguity is more likely Yang et al. (2025). To model this, we compute ap-
proximate spatial gradients using finite differences:
Gh(x) = |I(x + 1, y) −I(x, y)| ,
Gv(x) = |I(x, y + 1) −I(x, y)| .
(7)
An edge magnitude map is formed and normalized:
E(x) = 1
3 (Gh(x) + Gv(x)) ,
ˆE(x) =
E(x)
maxx∈ΩE(x) + ε.
(8)
4


<!-- page 5 -->
Color-Structure Dual Students for Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation
We then identify structurally salient regions:
MS(x) = I[ ˆE(x) > τstructure].
(9)
Finally, the uncertainty map is further refined by emphasizing these structure-rich areas:
eUS(x) = eUC(x) · (1 + λS · MS(x)) ,
(10)
where λS ∈[0, 1] controls the strength of modulation. The final uncertainty map eUS inte-
grates both chromatic and structural information, yielding a perception-aware enhancement
that emphasizes regions of higher epistemic risk.
2.3 Training Procedure
We denote the teacher network as T , the color student as C, and the structure student as
S. In the supervised phase, the loss is computed as:
Lsup = LCE+Dice(C(xl), yl) + LCE+Dice(S(xl), yl),
(11)
where LCE+Dice denotes the average of the cross-entropy loss and Dice loss. In the unsuper-
vised phase, for each unlabeled sample xu ∈Du, we define two augmentation pipelines: AC ∈
{color jittering, histogram matching} for color perturbation and AS ∈{elastic transformation}
for structural deformation. Pseudo-labels are generated by the teacher T , and consistency
is enforced through uncertainty-weighted losses:
Lunsup = eUC(xu) · LCE+Dice(C(AC(xu)), T (xu))
+ eUS(xu) · LCE+Dice(S(AS(xu)), T (AS(xu)))
(12)
Finally, the total training loss combines both objectives:
Ltotal = Lsup + λunsupLunsup,
(13)
where λunsup is a weighting factor that controls the unsupervised loss contribution.
3 Experiments
3.1 Datasets
We evaluated our proposed method on two publicly available histopathological benchmarks.
GlaS Sirinukunwattana et al. (2017) is a gland segmentation dataset for colorectal adeno-
carcinoma across various cancer stages, containing 165 images (37 benign, 48 malignant, and
80 test) with resolutions around 775×522 or 589×453. CRAG Graham et al. (2019) targets
gland segmentation in colon histopathology, comprising 213 annotated images, mostly sized
1512×1516. It is particularly challenging due to substantial variations in gland morphology
and staining. Following prior works, 20% of the images were used as a fixed test set, and
the remaining 80% were split into five folds for cross-validation on both datasets.

3.2 Implementation Details
All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU (16 GB VRAM) using
Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.5, and CUDA 12.2. We adopted DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101
backbone as the segmentation model for both GlaS and CRAG datasets, training for 80
and 120 epochs respectively, with all images resized to 256 × 256.
To enhance generalization, we applied shared augmentations across branches, including
random flips and rotations. Each student also received branch-specific augmentations tai-
lored to its objective. The Color Student used either color jittering or histogram matching
Ferrero et al. (2024) to improve robustness to appearance variations while preserving struc-
ture. In contrast, the Structure Student was augmented with elastic deformation Faryna
et al. (2021) to better capture structural distortions and fine-grained morphology.
Models were optimized using AdamW (lr = 1 × 10−4, β = (0.9, 0.999), ϵ = 1 × 10−8,
weight decay = 0.05) with a batch size of 4. During inference, the student model with the
best validation performance was used for prediction.

Color-Structure Dual Students for Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation
3.4 Quantitative Results
As shown in Table 1, CSDS consistently outperforms previous SOTA methods under lim-
ited supervision on both GlaS and CRAG datasets. On the Glas dataset, with only 10%
labeled data, CSDS achieves a Dice score of 82.86±1.24 and a Jaccard index of 72.01±1.81,
which surpasses strong co-training baselines like FDCL and CPS. In 5% labeled ratio, CSDS
narrows the Dice gap to full supervision to just 0.81%, while significantly outperforming
teacher-student methods (e.g., Mean Teacher) and self-training methods (e.g., FixMatch).
CSDS generalizes well across datasets, as evidenced by consistently outperforming all com-
pared methods under all settings on CRAG, which presents more irregular and challenging
nuclei structures.

Figure 2 shows qualitative results on GlaS (Rows 1–3) with 10% labeled data. While most
methods capture overall morphology, earlier approaches like UAMT and CPS struggle with
boundary precision and separating clustered glands. FDCL and CorrMatch improve but
still show artifacts. In contrast, CSDS produces cleaner, more accurate masks with sharper
boundaries, aligning with the quantitative results in Table 1. Rows 4 and 5 show results
on CRAG. While most methods fail to capture complete nuclei contours, causing under-
segmentation or fragmented boundaries, CSDS achieves the most consistent results with
clearer boundaries and better shape preservation.

Effect of EMA Strategies. As shown in Table 3, the Mean strategy, which updates the
teacher model by averaging the parameters of both students, consistently achieves the best
segmentation performance. In contrast, Alternate, which updates the teacher by switch-
ing between the two branches each epoch, and Best student only, which updates using the
student with higher validation performance, perform worse. These results suggest that ag-
gregating knowledge from both students yields more stable and informative teacher updates
by reducing potential variance and bias introduced by a single student branch.

4 Conclusion
In this work, we introduced Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework tailored for histopathology images. By decoupling color and struc-
tural cues into two specialized student networks guided by a shared teacher, CSDS captures
domain-specific variations more effectively. An uncertainty-aware training strategy further
improves pseudo-label reliability via color- and structure-adaptive weighting. Experiments
on GlaS and CRAG under limited-label settings show that CSDS consistently outperforms
strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the benefit of explicitly
modeling histopathology-specific visual cues.
