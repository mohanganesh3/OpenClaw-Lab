Abstract—The increasing digitization of medical imaging
enables machine learning based improvements in detecting,
visualizing and segmenting lesions, easing the workload for
medical experts. However, supervised machine learning requires
reliable labelled data, which is is often difﬁcult or impossible to
collect or at least time consuming and thereby costly. Therefore
methods requiring only partly labeled data (semi-supervised)
or no labeling at all (unsupervised methods) have been applied
more regularly. Anomaly detection is one possible methodol-
ogy that is able to leverage semi-supervised and unsupervised
methods to handle medical imaging tasks like classiﬁcation
and segmentation. This paper uses a semi-exhaustive literature
review of relevant anomaly detection papers in medical imaging
to cluster into applications, highlight important results, establish
lessons learned and give further advice on how to approach
anomaly detection in medical imaging. The qualitative analysis
is based on google scholar and 4 different search terms, resulting
in 120 different analysed papers. The main results showed that
the current research is mostly motivated by reducing the need
for labelled data. Also, the successful and substantial amount
of research in the brain MRI domain shows the potential for
applications in further domains like OCT and chest X-ray.

I. INTRODUCTION
The increasing digitization of medical imaging enables
the collection of data and machine learning (ML) based
approaches to aid medical experts. One powerful part of
ML comes from supervised methods, using both data and
corresponding labels in e.g. segmentation or classiﬁcation
models. However, since the collection of annotations (labels)
is often times time consuming and thereby costly [1] as
well as in many cases a conﬁdent ground truth even being
unobtainable, their usability is reduced. Due to this, semi-
supervised and unsupervised methods are applied. This is
often achieved through anomaly detection.
Deﬁnitions: Pathologies in medical images can often be
described as a rare deviance from a norm, or a non-anomalous
(in the case of medical imaging mostly healthy) sample.
This ﬁts the deﬁnition of outliers (or anomalies) in the
data, motivating the application of anomaly detection [2].
In this publication, the terms anomaly detection and out-
lier detection are used interchangeably. This is motivated
by the fact that outliers are sometimes deﬁned as valid
but out of order datapoints, while anomalies also include
further differences (e.g. different image capture modalities).
Therefore outliers can be deﬁned as a subset of anomalies.
Anomaly detection can be separated into 3 classes, point,
collective and contextual anomalies. Point anomaly detection
is the task of recognizing a single anomalous point from a
larger dataset. Most anomaly detection models handle point
anomalies. Collective anomalies are anomalies that may not
be identiﬁed as anomalies if viewed as a single point but as a
set of many they form an anomaly. Contextual anomalies can
only be recognized as anomalies if context is added. There are
also 3 different anomaly detection setups, supervised, semi-
supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection. Supervised
anomaly detection is comparable with classiﬁcation using a
very unbalanced dataset. Semi-supervised anomaly detection
aims to train a model on only one, typically the normal (in
our case healthy) class and then applies the model to both
healthy and pathological data, reporting the corresponding
scores. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses both, normal
and anomalous data, does not make use of labels at all and
works purely on intrinsic properties of the dataset (using
distances or densities) [3]. In anomaly detection, the usage of
semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD)
is confused, and repeatedly applied to both semi-supervised
and unsupervised methods. We believe that the separation
into semi-supervised (healthy data being clearly deﬁned) and
unsupervised (no deﬁnition of labels at all) makes sense and
advise to use this terminology as also pointed out by [3].
Deviation based anomaly detection:
Anomaly detection
using medical image data, e.g. computed tomography (CT)
scans, is typically performed using either convolutional neural
network (CNN) based feature extractors, followed by one-
class (OC) classiﬁers or deviation based methods like au-
toencoders (AEs) [4]–[6] or even more recently, generative
adversarial network (GAN) [7]–[9] based methods. Both
AEs and GANs use convolutional kernels, however their
applications in the sense of deviation based anomaly detection
are fundamentally different to CNN based feature extractors.
In order to generate deviation based scores from an AE, the
encoder of the encoder-decoder based neural network typi-
cally encodes a sample image into a lower dimensional latent
space, also called a bottleneck. The decoder uses this latent
space representation to recreate the sample and a deviation
between the sample and the reconstruction can be calculated.


<!-- page 2 -->
During training, this deviation is used to backpropagate and
update the network. The AE in an anomaly detection setting
is trained using healthy data to en- and decode features of
healthy samples, leading to a higher deviation for non-healthy
samples, assuming that there is a difference between the
learned healthy and the lesioned latent space [10]. GANs
can also be used to facilitate a deviation based score. In
addition to training a generator and a discriminator in an
adversarial setup, an additional encoder needs to be trained,
mapping the generated image back to the latent space (input to
generator) [7]. By doing this, any input image can be mapped
to a latent space and reconstructed into an image using the
generator. This results in a reconstruction which can be used
to facilitate a reconstruction loss.
Additionally there are conventional methods to facilitate
anomaly detection, using e.g. z-score thresholds [11], [12],
boxplots [13] or methods built on the ideas of principal
components analysis (PCA) [14], [15]. OC support vector
machines (SVM)s [16] are one of the most known semi-
supervised anomaly detection methods. In principle they
apply the ideas of SVMs (using hyperplanes to separate two
classes using support vectors with the aim of generating the
largest possible margin) to a OC problem. One possibility
to achieve this is to model a hypersphere to encompass all
support vectors, creating the smallest possible hypersphere.
Contribution: This papers contribution is the analysis of the
current state of anomaly detection in medical imaging. Using
this analysis, we show lessons learned and give an outlook
for future applications and research targets.
II. METHOD
The method used was a semi-exhaustive literature review
based on Randolph [17]. The formulated problem was the
evaluation of anomaly detection in medical imaging. For data
collection, the search engine Google Scholar was used. In
order to obtain meaningful results, the search terms anomaly
detection in medical imaging, unsupervised anomaly detection
in medical imaging, outlier detection in medical imaging
and unsupervised outlier detection in medical imaging were
chosen. From these results the following criteria for exclusion
were chosen. Only the ﬁrst 3 pages of results (sorted by
relevance, 10 articles per page) were used. Further, the criteria
for exclusion duplicate, in context of medical imaging (in
abstract, title or conclusion), peer-review and date were
identiﬁed. Since the search terms were similar, duplicates
had to be removed. Papers without a clear focus on medical
imaging in the abstract, title or conclusion were also removed.
A further criterion was to only include peer-reviewed research
items. This mainly lead to the exclusion of preprints. The data
timeframe was set to not include papers after the resurgence
of deep-learning (AlexNet [18]) and to still include papers
after the U-net was proposed [19], resulting in a timeframe
of January 2015 −July 2021. This lead to a reduction of
papers from 120 to 49. Since these papers also included 4
survey papers, the ﬁnal number of application based research
papers was 45. These survey papers were used as a qualitative
comparision to the our extracted lessons learned. Next, the
papers were manually clustered with respect to their imaging
method and the following information was extracted: Aim,
Applied Method and Results. From these clusters, lessons
learned were extracted, which are reported in section III.
III. RESULTS
The semi-exhaustive literature review resulted in 45 re-
search items, from which further 6 were removed due to not
containing applications in medical imaging (only exemplar
stated in abstract) or being non-available. The resulting papers
were further clustered into 5 categories (corresponding to Tab.
I-V by their imaging methods. Tab. I shows papers applying
anomaly detection to occular medical images with retinal
fundus images and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
Tab. II focuses on papers with applications in the center body
region, with chest X-rays and mammography. Tab. III sum-
marizes application papers, using CT and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Tab. IV displays papers applying
ML to brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets.
Tab. V shows mixed applications from the domains of breast
ultrasound, chest radiographs, histology and fundus images
as well as multi-spectral imaging (MSI).
Overall, these tables show a narrow ﬁeld of application
with 15 (38.46%) of all selected papers working on MRI
scans of the brain. Further 6 papers use fMRI and CT
scans of the brain, increasing the amount of brain image
data based applications to 53.85%. Further clusters could be
observed using chest X-rays and mammography, as well as
ocular imaging techniques, especially OCT. Of note is, that
although medical imaging includes methods like histology,
only 1 paper [20] applied anomaly detection to such data.
A further result is the relevance of deviation based methods,
with 27 papers (69.23%) applying some form or adaptation,
mostly using autoencoders AEs or GANs [7]–[9], [20]–[43].
Investigating MRIs, 7 [37], [39], [40], [42]–[45] of the 15
publications using brain MRI data focus explicitly on tumours
or metastases, showing the usefulness of anomaly detection
and segmentation of tumours in brains using MRI. Most other
brain MRI based methods more generally handle the task of
lesion classiﬁcation or segmentation with only two focusing
speciﬁcly on cerebral small vessel diseases [41], [46]. A
further cluster uses X-ray for the detection of pneumonia
[23], [47] or lung disease like COVID-19 [15]. Several
advancements have also been made in OCT segmentation of
retina lesions [7], [8], [25], [26], [48], with one publication
performing visual touring test using 2 experts, which were
unable to recognize differences in the correctly reconstructed
data [8]. Breast cancer and pathology detection was also
improved using anomaly detection [28], [29], [49].
One result of this analysis is the statement that anomaly
detection can be motivated by the lack of available labelled
training data, which was stated in 19 publications. The
reported results of these papers proved that these semi-
and unsupervised approaches successfully completed their
tasks [7], [8], [14], [20], [22], [24]–[26], [28], [29], [31],

[33], [36], [38], [40], [41], [44], [48], [49]. However, some
papers also show semi-supervised methods outperforming
fully supervised methods. These outperforming methods are
based on classical feature extraction followed by multiple-
instance learning (MIL) based models [49], through adap-
tations to GANs [27] (using skip-connections and weight-
sharing subnetworks) and through the adaptation of AEs to
the SegAE model [32] (using pairs of T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR
data for improved anomaly detection). For this improvement
in comparison to fully supervised models, Khosla et al. [32]
reason that fully supervised methods systematically either
under or overestimate lesion volumes (when segmenting le-
sions), while their proposed method was reported to be free
of this bias.
Zhang et al. and Kim et al. both show interesting ap-
proaches, applying conventional feature extractors (CNN and
edge detection) with further OC classiﬁers (fully connected
neural networks and recurrent neural networks). By using
these methods both papers reach relatively high scores, but
still lower scores then their CT based baselines.
A further ﬁnding is the obvious bias in the amount of
research items regarding OCT, chest X-Ray, mammography
and Brain MRI. An investigation in the used datasets shows
a strong dataset and community driven effect. For all of
the above mentioned image categories, datasets are publicly
available. Further, a community driven effect can be observed,
comparing new models against older ones, evaluated on the
same dataset.
In addition to medical image based application papers, sev-
eral authors proposed improvements to the general anomaly
detection pipelines. 3 papers showed an improvement of
subsequent methods by removing anomalies from the data or
reducing complexity in the data [11], [12], [14]. Also, con-
straint programming is shown successfully by Kuo et al. [50].
showing further approaches to perform anomaly detection.
CycleGAN is also shown to work for transforming images
into a space that showed reduced image artefacts [31]. Heer et
al. [38] showed issues with the general idea of anomaly detec-

tion and their application of anomalies as out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, remarking a blind spot using deviation based
methods. They state that denoting anomalies as OOD is
dangerous, since non anomalous data from different sensors
or image modalities may also be detected as OOD although
this data not being anomalous. In their paper they further
present a method based on prior knowledge to disentangle
lesion based OOD from non-lesion based counterparts.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper we analysed the current state of research in
anomaly detection using medical image data and extracted
lessons learned. To accomplish this, a semi-exhaustive lit-
erature review was performed, resulting in 120 papers, from
which 44 were further investigated (after ﬁlters were applied).
This resulted in 4 major clusters of image domains, with the
brain MRI domain comprising 39.45% of all papers.
One takeway is that especially in the brain MRI domain,
both lesion and tumour classiﬁcation as well as segmentation
have been successfully implemented multiple times. It is
shown that both AE and GAN based methods as well as Gaus-
sian mixture models, hidden Markov models and CNNs with
speciﬁc feature extractors can work in this anomaly detection
setup. This was further shown to be the case with chest X-ray,
mammography as well as OCT data. Extrapolating from these
results, ﬁrst approaches in similar domains, using anomaly
detection for tasks in the domains of e.g. CT scans of the
skeleton or spines seem promising and should be investigated.
Also, an investigation of the suitability for histological data
would be of high interest, since histological data was very
under-represented (1 publication). However, there are multiple
differences between CT/MRI and histology. In histology it
is not sufﬁcient to detect a large object (e.g. tumor) which
is indicated by different intensity values. It would rather be
important to learn the shape and interaction of nuclei and
cells which is supposed to be a more challenging task, relying
more on high frequency information which is a reported weak
point of several proposed deviation based mehtods. Further,
histology images are extremely high resolution, leading to
issues using current GAN or AE based anomaly detection.
ˇStepec et al. [20] show one way to circumvent these issues
successfully using patch extraction and MIL.
As reported in the results, there were some semi-supervised
anomaly detection models that resulted in higher or similar


<!-- page 5 -->
scores than their fully supervised alternatives. One inter-
pretation is that, especially regarding segmentation, human
labelled segmentation masks with rough edges may introduce
bias. This is however still unclear and should further be
investigated.
Another useful takeaway is that not only improvements
to state of the art (SOTA) models are needed but also
simpler models or cheaper image modalities can be a major
improvement, even if the SOTA scores cannot be reached
e.g. replacing CT with X-ray based methods. One example
was shown by Zhang et al. [47] who used X-ray images,
approaching relatively high scores. Although their method did
not outperform the CT based baselines, the methods is still
of high signiﬁcance, since it reached similar levels using X-
rays requiring a lower radiation dose and an more available
imaging method.
As stated by [52] we also recognized the generation of free
and comparable datasets as a high priority to facilitate further
research. The fast growing brain MRI community showed,
that open datasets are an important asset to boost research.
Therefore the development and open distribution should be
pursued for different medical image domains. In order to fa-
cilitate anomaly detection research, a semi-supervised dataset
(only including a small amount of annotations) should be
developed.
A disadvantage, reported by several deep learning based
approaches was [30], [44], that results were still unstable and
more research was needed before a clinical application could
be performed. This however was not always the case [22]
but there are still doubts in the clinical applicability of deep
learning based anomaly detection methods. Large clinical
application studies would be needed to show their suitability.
Conclusion: In this paper we investigated the current state
of research in medical image based anomaly detection and
generated lessons learned. The lessons learned can be con-
verted into the following future targets: a very narrow domain
of application that should be expanded, development of freely
accessible datasets, investigation of the OCT blindspot and
improvements of working approaches like constraints on the
AE bottleneck.
