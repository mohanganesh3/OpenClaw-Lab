Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with external
environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents. However, it
remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from
trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive
training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose  Reflexion , a
novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead
through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on
task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic
memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is
flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form
language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals,
and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks
(sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion
achieves a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation
and analysis studies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation
methods, and agent types, and provide insights into how they affect performance.
We release all code, demos, and datasets at  https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion .

1  Introduction

Recent works such as ReAct  [ 30 ] , SayCan  [ 1 ] ,
Toolformer  [ 22 ] , HuggingGPT  [ 23 ] ,
generative agents  [ 19 ] , and WebGPT  [ 17 ] 
have demonstrated the feasibility of
autonomous decision-making agents that are built on top of a large language
model (LLM) core. These methods use LLMs to generate text and ‘actions‘
that can be used in API calls and executed in an environment. Since they
rely on massive models with an enormous number of parameters, such approaches
have been so far limited to using in-context examples as a way of teaching
the agents, since more traditional optimization schemes like reinforcement
learning with gradient descent require substantial amounts of compute and
time.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach called  Reflexion  that uses verbal reinforcement to help agents learn from prior failings. Reflexion converts binary or scalar feedback from the environment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional context for the LLM agent in the next episode. This self-reflective feedback acts as a ‘semantic’ gradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn from prior mistakes to perform better on the task. This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to accomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner – by reflecting on their previous failures in order to form an improved plan of attack for the next attempt. For example, in figure

1  , a Reflexion agent learns to
optimize its own behavior to solve decision-making, programming, and reasoning tasks through
trial, error, and self-reflection.

Generating useful reflective feedback is challenging since it requires a good understanding of where the model made mistakes (i.e. the credit assignment problem  [ 25 ] ) as well as the ability to generate a summary containing actionable insights for improvement. We explore three ways for
doing this – simple binary environment feedback, pre-defined heuristics for common failure
cases, and self-evaluation such as binary classification using LLMs (decision-making) or
self-written unit tests (programming). In all implementations, the evaluation signal is
amplified to natural language experience summaries which can be stored in long-term memory.

Reflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or value-based learning: 1) it is lightweight and doesn’t require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more nuanced forms of feedback (e.g. targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards that are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and interpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints for actions in future episodes. At the same time, it does have the disadvantages of relying on the power of the LLM’s self-evaluation capabilities (or heuristics) and not having a formal guarantee for success. However, as LLM capabilities improve, we only expect this paradigm to get better over time.

We perform experiments on (1) decision-making tasks to test sequential action choices over long
trajectories, (2) reasoning tasks to test knowledge-intensive, single-step generation
improvement, and (3) programming tasks to teach the agent to effectively use external
tools such as compilers and interpreters. Across all three types of tasks, we observe
Reflexion agents are better decision-makers, reasoners, and programmers. More concretely,
Reflexion agents improve on decision-making AlfWorld  [ 24 ]  tasks over strong baseline approaches by
an absolute 22% in 12 iterative learning steps, and
on reasoning questions in HotPotQA  [ 28 ]  by 20%, and Python programming
tasks on HumanEval  [ 6 ]  by as much as 11%.

To summarize, our contributions are the following:

•

We propose Reflexion, a new paradigm for ‘verbal‘ reinforcement that parameterizes a policy as an
agent’s memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters.

•

We explore this emergent property of  self-reflection  in LLMs and empirically
show that self-reflection is extremely useful to learn complex tasks over a handful of trials.

•

We introduce LeetcodeHardGym, a code-generation RL gym environment consisting
of 40 challenging Leetcode questions (‘hard-level‘) in 19 programming languages.

•

We show that Reflexion achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results on various code generation benchmarks.

Reasoning and decision-making

Self-Refine  [ 15 ]  employs an iterative framework for
self-refinement to autonomously improve generation through self-evaluation.
These self-evaluation and self-improvement steps are conditioned on
given task constraints, such as "How can this generation be written
in a more positive way". Self-Refine is effective
but is limited to single-generation reasoning tasks.  Pryzant et al., [ 21 ] 
performs a similar semantic prompt-writing optimization, but is
also limited to single-generation tasks.
 Paul et al., [ 20 ]  fine-tune critic models to provide intermediate
feedback within trajectories to improve reasoning responses.
 Xie et al., [ 27 ]  use stochastic beam search over actions to
perform a more efficient decision-making search strategy which allows
the agent to use foresight advantage due to its self-evaluation component.
 Yoran et al., [ 31 ]  and  Nair et al., [ 16 ]  use decider models
to reason over several generations.  Kim et al., [ 10 ]  use a
retry pattern over a fixed number of steps without an evaluation step.
 Goodman, [ 9 ]  perform a qualitative evaluation step that
proposes optimizations to the previous generation. In this paper, we show that several
of these concepts can be enhanced with  self-reflection  to
build a persisting memory of self-reflective exper
