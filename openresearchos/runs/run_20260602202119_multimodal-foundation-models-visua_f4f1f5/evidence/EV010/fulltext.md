Abstract

With the recent significant advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs), the importance of their grounding capability in visual chat is increasingly recognized. Despite recent efforts to enable LMMs to support grounding, their capabilities for grounding and chat are usually separate, and their chat performance drops dramatically when asked to ground. The problem is the lack of a dataset for grounded visual chat (GVC). Existing grounding datasets only contain short captions. To address this issue, we have created GVC data that allows for the combination of grounding and chat capabilities. To better evaluate the GVC capabilities, we have introduced a benchmark called Grounding-Bench. Additionally, we have proposed a model design that can support GVC and various types of visual prompts by connecting segmentation models with language models. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other LMMs on Grounding-Bench. Furthermore, our model achieves competitive performance on classic grounding benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K Entities.

1  Introduction

With the success of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4  [  25  ]  and the open-sourced substitutes LLaMA  [  31  ] , researchers are eager to leverage their strong language capabilities in the field of vision. This enthusiasm has led to a surge in the development of large multimodal models (LLMs). Previous LMMs, such as LLaVA  [  18  ]  and miniGPT-4  [  49  ] , have demonstrated exceptional visual chat abilities by generating plausible responses based on images and user instructions. However, they often encounter challenges in providing responses that exhibit a fine-grained understanding of images, including specific regions and alignment with related image regions—this is often referred to as visual grounding.

For CogVLM  [  33  ] , two different model checkpoints are released: CogVLM-Grounding is the grounding model and CogVLM-Chat is the chat model. Grounding and Visual Chat scores represent the

Recognizing the significance of visual grounding for LMMs, recent research efforts have focused on developing grounding and referring capabilities for LMMs  [  3  ,

10  ] . While these models have achieved performance comparable to specialized models  [  21  ,

19  ]  on classic grounding benchmarks such as RefCOCO  [  8  ]  and Flickr30K  [  29  ] , they often treat grounding as a distinct task that requires customized prompts to initiate. Consequently, their text responses undergo significant changes when tasked with grounding. Most models, such as MiniGPT-v2  [  2  ]  and CogVLM-Grounding  [  33  ] , can only generate short captions when performing grounding, as they are primarily trained on grounding caption data like Flickr30K. As illustrated in Fig.  1  , these earlier models struggle to excel simultaneously in both chat and grounding tasks. BuboGPT [  47  ]  maintains chat capability by leveraging an external grounding model for grounding, but this approach can be constrained by the performance of the language encoder in the grounding model. Shikra  [  3  ]  engages in referential dialog, which includes grounded chat, but its performance is limited due to the scarcity of available data. All existing LMMs  [  3  ,

40  ,

33  ]  only support outputting coordinates as text, which restricts localization performance, and they do not support pixel-wise grounding and referring. In summary, previous LMMs struggle to perform grounded visual chat effectively due to the scarcity of grounded visual chat data and suboptimal model designs. Furthermore, they lack the capability for pixel-wise grounding and referring.

To address these challenges, we contribute to grounded visual chat in three key areas: data creation, network architecture, and benchmarking. When annotating grounding data, previous methods such as Kosmos-2  [  28  ]  and GPT4ROI  [  46  ]  rely on pretrained grounding models or detection models to predict bounding boxes based on existing captions. In contrast, we label grounded visual chat data using human-labeled object detection data  [  15  ] .

Our data creation process begins by leveraging GPT-4  [  25  ] , following the data creation method used in LLaVA  [  18  ] . We provide GPT-4 with chat data and ground-truth instances, instructing it to match instances with noun phrases in the chat data. This approach benefits from the high quality of human-labeled instances and chat data generated by GPT-4, ensuring minimal noise in the data annotation pipeline. In total, we annotated

grounded visual chat data.

In terms of network architecture, we propose connecting the output features of the Language Model (LLM) with a grounding model to handle grounding tasks, relieving the language model from the burden of vision localization tasks. For this purpose, we use the open-set segmentation and detection model OpenSeeD  [  44  ]  as the grounding model, enabling both box and pixel-level grounding simultaneously.

To evaluate the capability of grounded visual chat, we introduce the Grounding Bench, a benchmark that assesses grounding and chat performances concurrently. Built upon the foundation of LLaVA bench, our benchmark evaluates chat and phrase grounding in three contexts: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. Additionally, recognizing that grounded detailed description is the most challenging aspect of grounded visual chat, we propose grounded recall and precision metrics. Grounded recall measures the proportion of ground-truth instances correctly mentioned and grounded, while grounded precision measures the accuracy of groundings or predicted boxes. We also calculate the

score, a combination of precision and recall. To evaluate the correctness of semantic matching since the models generate free-form phrases, we rely on GPT-4.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

1.

We introduce a data annotation pipeline to label high-quality Grounded Visual Chat (GVC) data. Leveraging human-labeled object detection data  [  15  ]  and harnessing the robust matching capability of GPT-4  [  27  ] , we have successfully labeled 150K GVC instances using the LLaVA instruction tuning dataset.

We present an end-to-end model, named LLaVA-Grounding (LLaVA-G for brevity), which connects a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) with a grounding model to facilitate grounded visual chat. Our model supports both object and pixel-level grounding, accommodating various visual prom
